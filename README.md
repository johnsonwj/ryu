# ryu

Implements the [ryÅ«](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu) algorithm for formatting floating-point numbers, which is originally due to Ulf Adams. This algorithm was published under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) license.

This algorithm relies on pregenerated lookup tables to improve performance; these are generated by Template Haskell so that they can be included directly in the compiled binary.
